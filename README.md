# -Sorting algorithms & Big O

## About this group project:

### In this section, we will look at some sorting algorithms wrote in C. Such as:

1. - **Bubble sort**
    -Bubble sort repeats steps through a list of elements, swaps if they are wrong and compares adjacent items.
2. - **Insertion sort**
    -It builds a sorted array one by one.
3. - **Selection sort**
    -Works by finding the minimum element fron a unsorted part of an array. Then it places it at the beginning of the sorted array.
4. - **Quick sort**
    -It is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that divide an array into smaller subarrays and sorts these, independently to achieve a sorted array.
